What is nmap?

1. **Nmap  short for **Network Mapper**, is a free and open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing.

2. It is widely used by cybersecurity professionals to identify devices on a network, discover open ports, and detect services running on those ports.

3. Nmap works by sending specially crafted packets to target systems and analyzing the responses.

4. One of its most common scanning techniques is the **TCP SYN scan**, which helps identify open ports without completing the full TCP handshake.

5. By analyzing open ports and services, Nmap helps in assessing the security posture of a system or network.

6. It can also detect operating systems, service versions, and even run vulnerability detection scripts using its **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)**.

7. Nmap is available on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and it also has a graphical interface called **Zenmap**.

8. In cybersecurity, Nmap is considered a foundational tool for **reconnaissance** â€” the first phase in ethical hacking or penetration testing.
